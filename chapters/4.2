Block Types
Our static site generator supports 6 types of markdown blocks:

paragraph
heading
code
quote
unordered_list
ordered_list

We need a way to inspect a block of markdown text and determine what type of block it is.

Assignment
-Create a BlockType enum with the block types from above.
-Create a block_to_block_type function that takes a single block of markdown text as input and returns the BlockType representing the type of block it is. 
You can assume all leading and trailing whitespace were already stripped (we did that in a previous lesson).
  -- Headings start with 1-6 # characters, followed by a space and then the heading text.
  -- Code blocks must start with 3 backticks and end with 3 backticks.
  -- Every line in a quote block must start with a > character.
  -- Every line in an unordered list block must start with a - character, followed by a space.
  -- Every line in an ordered list block must start with a number followed by a . character and a space. The number must start at 1 and increment by 1 for each line.
  -- If none of the above conditions are met, the block is a normal paragraph.
-Write a bunch of unit tests for the function.
Run and submit the CLI tests from the root of the project.
